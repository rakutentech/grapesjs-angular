## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Submit an Issue

Please fill the following information in each issue you submit:

- Title: Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Description: Description of the issue.
- Steps to Reproduce: numbered step by step. (1,2,3.â€¦ and so on)
- Expected behaviour: What you expect to happen.
- Actual behaviour: What actually happens.
- How often reproduces?: what percentage of the time does it reproduce?
- Version: the version of the app.
- Repository: Link to the repository you are working with.
- Operating system: The operating system used.
- Additional information: Any additional to help to reproduce. (screenshots, animated gifs)

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the project
2. Implement feature/fix bug & add test cases
3. Ensure test cases & static analysis runs succesfully
4. Submit a pull request to `main` branch
   Please include unit tests where necessary to cover any functionality that is introduced.

## Coding Guidelines

- All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more unit tests/specs
- All public API methods **must be documented** in jsdoc and potentially in the user guide.

## Commit messages

Each commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.
Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.
Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

> You can install [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and use it instead of `git commit` to generate correctly formated commit messages. 

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gradle, fastlane, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes (no scope needed)
- **feat**: A new feature (no scope needed)
- **fix**: A bug fix (no scope needed)
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance (no scope needed)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (no scope needed)
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) (no scope needed)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests (no scope needed)

### Scope

You should only provide a scope for commits with **build** or **ci** types (cf. type examples above).
Other types of commit are by default under the library's scope (@rakutentech/grapesjs-angular) and can be omitted.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
